# RoboScope Kit

`roboscope-kit` connects your model to RoboScope's official simulation benchmarks. You implement one
`Policy` class; RoboScope provides the simulators, schedules the evaluation, tunes its concurrency, and
scores the results. You do not install simulator packages or set scheduling parameters.

```bash
python -m pip install roboscope-kit
```

Python 3.11 or newer is required. The import name is `roboscope_kit`.

> Versions up to `0.7.0b77` were published as `roboscope-inference-sdk` and imported as
> `roboscope_inference_sdk`. From `0.8.0b1` on, use `roboscope-kit` and `roboscope_kit`; no alias is
> provided.

## Quick start

```python
import numpy as np

from roboscope_kit import ActionChunk, BenchmarkName, Policy, PolicyCapabilities, run


class UserPolicy(Policy):
    def load(self, context):
        self.model = load_model(context.checkpoint_path)
        return PolicyCapabilities(
            supported_benchmarks=(BenchmarkName.LIBERO,),
            required_features=("images.primary", "state.proprioception"),
            supported_suites={BenchmarkName.LIBERO: ("libero_10",)},
            supported_action_chunk_sizes=(1,),
        )

    def act(self, observation):
        return ActionChunk(np.asarray(self.model.predict(observation.features), dtype=np.float32))


run(UserPolicy())
```

RoboScope starts this script once per inference replica. It passes the staged checkpoint and the
benchmark contract to `Policy.load()`, then calls `act()` through a local socket. Your process never starts
a simulator or chooses how many evaluators run.

## How evaluation works

You evaluate a model by building your own image: it contains your `Policy`, its dependencies, and the
file `/workspace/roboscope-policy.json`, which tells RoboScope how to start the Policy:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "command": ["/opt/user/bin/python", "/workspace/user_policy.py"],
  "cwd": "/workspace"
}
```

RoboScope validates this file before every quick test and scored evaluation. The benchmark environments,
datasets, and evaluators come from RoboScope's shared storage, not from your image. You do not configure the
file path, the concurrency, or any benchmark runtime flags.

Every evaluation supports a real quick test (one Worker, one Server) and a full scored run. The runtime is
built on three ideas:

- **Server**: a process that loads one replica of your `Policy` and answers action requests over a local
  socket. Several Workers can share one Server, which can batch their requests. Autotune calls the number of
  Servers `g`.
- **Worker**: a process that owns one simulator. It claims Work Items, runs their episodes, sends
  observations to a Server, and applies the returned actions. It never loads your model. Autotune calls the
  number of Workers `K`.
- **Work Item**: the unit of benchmark work, claimed atomically from a durable queue. Its size depends on
  the benchmark; a RoboTwin Work Item, for example, is a window of episodes from one task. If a Worker fails,
  its Work Item goes back to the queue; a finished Work Item is recorded once and can never be scored twice.

### Automatic tuning (K/g)

RoboScope picks `K` and `g` for you by running real episodes with your Policy. Every candidate runs the same
fixed, representative set of episodes. The smallest safe `K` sets a success-rate baseline; a faster
candidate is accepted only if it keeps at least 85% of that baseline and stays within resource limits.
Candidates that lose Workers, run out of memory, or leave episodes unfinished are rejected.

Each candidate is limited to 15 minutes and the whole search to 30 minutes, after which the last healthy
pair is used. Progress is written to `/root/testresult/autotune/selection.json` as candidates start,
advance, and stop. Tuning episodes never count toward the score.

The default search, `two-phase`, ramps `K` on one replica per GPU and then ramps replicas when GPU
utilization shows inference is the bottleneck. A benchmark manifest can select the `diagonal` search with
`autotune_strategy: diagonal`. It doubles `K` on one replica per GPU until a doubling raises throughput by
less than 25% (a step the CPU cap shortens needs the same share of linear scaling); the accepted `K` per
replica is how many Workers one replica keeps busy. It then adds one replica per GPU at a time with `K`
scaled by that ratio, keeping each step that raises throughput by at least 3% and skipping a step whose
busiest GPU, extrapolated from the measured replica footprint and the marginal memory per Worker, would
not fit. It compares steady-state throughput: each probe gives every Worker three work items, drops each
Worker's first item, and stops measuring when the first Worker runs out of work. Probes it measures but
does not keep are marked `rejected` in `selection.json`.

### Progress and errors

RoboTwin and RoboCasa report each finished episode as it completes, so progress moves while a long Work
Item is still running; the official score still uses only each item's final result. Progress is published
to the status file `testlog.txt`.

All runtime errors are appended to `/root/testresult/errors.jsonl`: recoverable Worker failures as well as
checkpoint, Policy Server, simulator, and configuration errors. When a RoboTwin simulator crashes with a
normal error exit, the episodes it finished are kept and the rest of that window count as failures, so the
evaluation continues. Out-of-memory and signal exits restart the Worker and replay its Work Item, with one
retry per run. Each component also keeps its own detailed log.

## Writing a Policy

### Capabilities and action contracts

`load()` returns `PolicyCapabilities`, which declares the benchmarks and suites you support, the
observation features you need, the action-chunk sizes that are safe for your model, and the maximum
inference batch size. It can also choose an action representation and an observation stride per benchmark:

```python
PolicyCapabilities(
    supported_benchmarks=(BenchmarkName.ROBOTWIN,),
    required_features=("images.head", "state.joints"),
    supported_action_chunk_sizes=(37,),
    action_representations={BenchmarkName.ROBOTWIN: "robotwin.ee-compact-quat-v1"},
    observation_strides={BenchmarkName.ROBOTWIN: 1},
)
```

The runtime checks each declared representation against the benchmark specification and requires every
replica to agree on the same action contract before evaluation starts. If you omit
`action_representations`, the benchmark default is used. The chosen contract and where it came from are
recorded in the inference metadata.

RoboTwin accepts a positive observation stride. The default is 1, so every new action chunk gets a fresh
observation. Randomized lighting, the viewer, video logging, and point-cloud observations always render
every step, whatever stride you declare.

Concurrency (`K`) and replica count (`g`) are not capabilities; RoboScope chooses them (see
[Automatic tuning](#automatic-tuning-kg)).

### Episode state

Before each episode the runtime calls `reset(EpisodeContext)`; every observation carries its `episode_id`;
when the episode ends it calls `end_episode(episode_id)`. The SDK forwards these calls but does not store
Policy state for you. If your Policy keeps state, key it by `episode_id` and release it in `end_episode()`.
The RoboScope user manual has stateful and stateless examples.

### Input preprocessing

Each benchmark sends its canonical observation unchanged: no model-specific resizing, normalization, or
channel/layout conversion. Your `Policy` does those transformations before calling the model, so model
input sizes are not part of the benchmark or Policy API.

## Supported benchmarks

Each benchmark has a platform execution chain in this package. The simulators, datasets, and assets come from
RoboScope's benchmark images and shared storage; they are not dependencies of the PyPI package.

| Benchmark | Execution chain | Provided by images or shared storage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LIBERO | SDK-native adapter and persistent LIBERO worker | Pinned LIBERO environment, simulator source, dataset, and initial states |
| LIBERO-Plus | SDK-native adapter reusing the LIBERO worker | Pinned LIBERO-Plus environment, simulator archive, dataset, and initial states |
| RoboTwin | SDK-native adapter and worker calling the pinned RoboTwin launcher | RoboTwin environment and source, deploy policy, checkpoint assets, and validated seed cache |
| RoboCasa | SDK-native adapter and persistent RoboCasa worker | Pinned RoboCasa environment, simulator and task source, and dataset assets |
| CALVIN | SDK-native adapter and persistent CALVIN worker | Pinned CALVIN environment, benchmark and config source, dataset, and evaluation-sequence manifest |
| MetaWorld | SDK-native adapter and persistent MetaWorld MT50 worker | Pinned MetaWorld/MuJoCo environment, task assets, and the frozen MT50 (seed 42) train-goal artifact |

LIBERO and CALVIN convert native observations to the canonical feature names and send native 7-dimensional
actions back to their simulators. CALVIN's task-D-to-task-D path runs the official 1,000 long-horizon
sequences with static and gripper images, proprioception, and language. The suites and runtime paths of
each benchmark are defined by its image manifest.

The exact contracts are in the protocol documents:

- [LIBERO](https://github.com/MINT-SJTU/RoboScope-Kit/blob/main/packages/roboscope-kit/LIBERO_EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md):
  `/root/startbenchmark.sh` arguments, checkpoint staging, observation/action mapping, episode setup and
  horizons, success detection, output files, error codes, and the validation sequence.
- [CALVIN](https://github.com/MINT-SJTU/RoboScope-Kit/blob/main/packages/roboscope-kit/CALVIN_EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md):
  manifest, observation/action mapping, official long-horizon evaluator, aggregation, and validation.
- [MetaWorld](https://github.com/MINT-SJTU/RoboScope-Kit/blob/main/packages/roboscope-kit/METAWORLD_EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md):
  MT50 manifest, camera setup, official training-goal evaluation, four-difficulty macro aggregation, and
  validation.
- [RoboTwin fixed inputs](https://github.com/MINT-SJTU/RoboScope-Kit/blob/main/benchmarks/starvla_platform_runtime/robotwin/SEED_PROTOCOL.md):
  since 0.7.0b51, images freeze RoboTwin's 50 × 100 inputs per suite under
  `robotwin2-platform-native-step-lim-v2`. The clean entries are unchanged and the randomized pool is new,
  so report randomized v1 and v2 scores separately.

Integration, autotune, and throughput measurements are in the
[benchmark results report](https://github.com/MINT-SJTU/RoboScope-Kit/blob/main/packages/roboscope-kit/docs/benchmark-results.md),
which reports LIBERO and RoboTwin separately.

## CUDA MPS (opt-in)

`--cuda-mps` runs the Policy replicas under NVIDIA CUDA MPS, so replicas sharing a GPU run their kernels
concurrently instead of taking turns. It is off by default; `run-benchmark.sh` accepts the same flag. With
it, the runtime:

- starts a private `nvidia-cuda-mps-control` daemon for the visible GPUs with 100% active-thread access, and
  refuses to start if another MPS daemon or server is already running;
- attaches every Policy replica to the daemon and fails the run if a replica is not an MPS client
  (simulator Workers are not attached);
- runs autotune and the scored pass in the same mode, so `K`/`g` are tuned for MPS;
- stops a replica's MPS clients through the daemon before stopping or rebuilding it, and shuts the daemon
  down when the run ends;
- writes daemon logs to `<output-dir>/cuda-mps/` and records the session under `cuda_mps` in `result.json`
  (`{"enabled": false}` when off).

The GPU must be in Default or Exclusive-Process compute mode, and the host must provide
`nvidia-cuda-mps-control`. Replicas pick their GPU by ordinal within the daemon's devices, so a Policy must
not change `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

## Cross-instance sharding (Beta)

Sharding splits one evaluation across several independent GPU instances. It is in Beta: enable Beta
features in your account settings, then turn on sharding for an evaluation and choose the instance count.
Ordinary evaluations are not sharded, and the feature also needs a released, verified image and launcher on
the platform; publishing the package alone does not enable it.

Every instance builds the same full list of Work Items and keeps the items whose position satisfies
`position % N == shard_index`. No coordination is needed, and RoboTwin seeds stay identical to a
single-instance run. Run one instance per shard:

```bash
python -m roboscope_kit.runtime.benchmark \
    --benchmark robotwin --suite demo_clean --checkpoint-source ... \
    --shard-index I --shard-count N --output-dir /runs/shard-I
```

Without `--shard-count`, the count is derived from the workload (one shard per 500 episodes, adjustable with
`--shard-episodes`), capped at the number of Work Items; an explicit count above that cap is rejected.
Quick tests cannot be sharded. Autotune always runs the full, unsharded probe on every instance; sharding
applies only to the scored pass. Each shard records its shard details in `manifest.json` and `result.json`.

When all shards finish, merge them. The merge checks that items are disjoint and fully covered, that terminal
record IDs are unique, and that each item has the right number of records:

```bash
python -m roboscope_kit.runtime.benchmark.shard_merge \
    --benchmark robotwin --suite demo_clean \
    --shard-dir /runs/shard-0 ... --shard-dir /runs/shard-N-1 \
    --output-dir /runs/merged
```

This merge rebuilds the workload from the image manifest, so it needs the same benchmark runtime assets
(including RoboTwin's seed cache). MetaWorld runs and merges must use the same `--evaluation-config` file.

The merged `result.json` contains only counts (successes, episodes, steps) plus each shard's provenance and
`result.json` SHA-256. Rates such as `steps_per_s` or `elapsed_s` are never combined across instances; report
cross-instance speedup against the whole job's wall-clock time.

Where neither the benchmark runtime nor the record trees are available, for example on a control plane,
merge from the shard `result.json` files alone:

```python
from roboscope_kit.runtime.benchmark.shard_reduce import merge_shard_results

merged = merge_shard_results([json.loads(text) for text in shard_result_texts])
```

It requires shard indexes exactly `0..N-1`, identical benchmark metadata (seeds, goals, evaluation
configuration) and package build across shards, and record counts that add up to the workload size, and it
raises `ValueError` otherwise. CALVIN and MetaWorld shards report raw partial counts, because their official
metrics are undefined on a subset; the merge derives the metrics only after confirming full coverage. This
reduction trusts the reported counts and cannot prove that each record is unique; use the record-tree merge
when you need that guarantee.

## Policy HIL model components

The package provides the model side of `policy_hil_continuous`: checkpoint discovery, immutable
verification, Pi0.5 loading, processor construction, and the pinned LeRobot RTC configuration. It is not a
robot-control service and never owns CAN, cameras, recording, progress, or uploads.

A separately packaged robot-side HIL service imports `load_pi05_runtime` and keeps the official
`RTCInferenceEngine`, the model, processor pipelines, robot arms, and cameras in one Python process; there is
no action-chunk wire protocol. Checkpoints and the model resources they reference must live under
explicitly allowed roots. The caller gets a `VerifiedCheckpoint` from `CheckpointCatalog`, records its
hashes in the collection session, and passes it to the component factory together with an explicit local
tokenizer path, because deployed checkpoints may contain paths from the training host. It requires the
pinned LeRobot 0.6.0 used by the validated Pi0.5 RTC deployment.

## Python support

Supported versions follow the [CPython release lifecycle](https://devguide.python.org/versions/): every
released version in its bugfix or security phase. Today that is Python 3.11–3.15. Python 3.8–3.10 are not
supported, and loading the package source through `PYTHONPATH` does not make them supported.

Model frameworks and simulators keep their own pinned interpreters and dependencies; installing
`roboscope-kit` does not install or upgrade them. Simulator environments still pinned to Python 3.8
(CALVIN, RoboTwin) or 3.10 (LIBERO) must be upgraded and validated separately before they can use this
package.

The supported list is declared in `pyproject.toml` under `tool.roboscope.python-support`. On every change,
CI builds one wheel and sdist, installs both on each listed version, imports every module without loading
simulators or models, and runs the regression tests. It also checks the Python 3.11 standard-library
baseline and fails when the list drifts from the official lifecycle.

## Versioning and releases

The names in `roboscope_kit.__all__` are the public API. Everything under `roboscope_kit.runtime` is
platform internals; do not depend on its classes or command-line arguments unless this document says so.
Installing from PyPI gives you the public `Policy` API and protocol client, not the simulators, datasets,
or image dependencies those internal modules need.

The package follows Semantic Versioning. During the `0.x` Beta series, a minor release may change
`__all__`, the `Policy` lifecycle, or the wire protocol incompatibly; patch releases only fix bugs. Every
evaluation image pins one exact version. Pin the version you validated in your own image, and read the
[changelog](https://github.com/MINT-SJTU/RoboScope-Kit/blob/main/packages/roboscope-kit/CHANGELOG.md)
before moving to a new minor version. `1.0.0` will freeze the `Policy` lifecycle and the compatibility
policy.

Read the installed version with `importlib.metadata.version("roboscope-kit")`; `roboscope_kit.__version__`
is not public API.

Releases are published automatically. To release, update the version in `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, move
the changelog's unreleased entries into a dated section that lists every user-visible API,
`Policy`-lifecycle, and wire-protocol change, and merge to `main`. GitHub Actions then builds the wheel and
sdist, tests them on every supported Python version, uploads them with the `PYPI_API_TOKEN` repository
secret, and checks the published hashes and a clean install. A version already on PyPI is not uploaded
again. To retry a failed upload, run the `SDK compatibility` workflow manually on `main`.

`CHANGELOG.md` ships in the sdist but not in the wheel.

Earlier source releases had a `libero` extra that only installed `imageio[ffmpeg]` and never a runnable
LIBERO simulator, so it was removed. If you use `imageio` directly, declare `imageio[ffmpeg]>=2.34,<3.0` in
your own dependencies.
